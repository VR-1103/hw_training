This repo contains the helper code files. Please create a branch with the format hw_training_<your_first_name>

Fill in the code according to the assignment and add launch files as well. At the end of the assignment, your branch should contain two packages. 
</br>
One for the base-station where the joystick will be run.
</br>
Second for on-board the rover. Document the commands that need to run to launch both scripts within your final report.
